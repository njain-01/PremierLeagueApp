## PremierLeagueApp
Created as part of the course CSE202:Fundamentals of Database Management System at IIITD.

An application presenting database for a football league to users through GUI made using JavaFx. The application mimics the administration process of a 
football league and has following features:
1) Fixtures for all matches.
2) Information for all matches for example home team, away team, refree assigned, stadium name, etc.
3) Results of all completed matches including scores, possession times for both teams, etc.
4) Information about all players including jersey number, field position, etc.
5) Information about each stadium including number of seats, parking space, stc.
6) User profiles -> a user/fan can create their profile to stay up-to-date about upcoming matches, book tickets, etc.
7) A special feature that we added in the application was for a user to create a fantasy football team and win rewards like tickets to a match.
8) We also added a feature to simulate a match using randomisations to help a reviewer understand the population of various database tables.
